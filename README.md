# Resume Template

My personal resume's _template_, written with [typst](https://github.com/typst/typst) and initially based on the
[basic-resume template](ttps://typst.app/universe/package/basic-resume).

This template contains the main files needed to compile my resume, except that it is filled with fake data instead of my
own.

## Usage

To compile a resume to PDF, you need to install `typst` first (for instance with `brew install typst`), and then run
`typst compile` on a main `typst` file. For instance, run:

```shell
typst compile ./resume-english.typ
```
